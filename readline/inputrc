# Readline configuration
# ======================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Configures the behavior of _GNU's_ _Readline_ library used for example
# by the _Bash_ shell in its interactive mode for line editing.
#
# When a program which uses the _Readline_ library starts up, _Readline_
# reads and executes commands from its config files but only if these
# exist and are readable.  It first reads its system-wide config file
# `/etc/inputrc`.  It then continues to read its user-specific config
# file `~/.inputrc`.
#
# This config file shall contain only non-default settings in order to
# keep it lean and thus easy to understand and maintain.
