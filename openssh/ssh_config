# = Configuration of OpenSSH SSH client
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Configures the _OpenSSH_ _SSH_ _Secure SHell_ client.
#
# The _SSH_ client program obtains its configuration from the below
# sources in the following order:
#
#   . Command line options.
#
#   . User configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`).
#
#   . System configuration file (`/etc/ssh/ssh_config`).
#
# For each setting only the first encountered value will be used.  The
# configuration files contain sections separated by `Host` name patterns
# and a setting from that section with a pattern which best matches a
# given host is chosen.  The host name is usually given on the command
# line (see the `CanonicalizeHostname` option for exceptions).
#
# Since only the first obtained value for each setting is used, sections
# with more host-specific patterns must come before ones with less
# specific patterns.  The most general section `Host *`, i.e. the one
# with the least host-specific pattern, must be the last section of this
# configuration file.
