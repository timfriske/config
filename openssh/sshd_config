# = Configuration of OpenSSH daemon
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Configures _OpenSSH's_ _Secure SHell_ daemon program.  The _OpenSSH_
# daemon is used in combination with a _SSH_ compatible client to
# establish a secure connection between two untrusted hosts over an
# insecure network.
#
# Empty lines are ignored but may be used to divide the content of this
# configuration file into logical blocks.  Lines whose first
# non-whitespace character is the `#` hash sign are ignored but may be
# used as comments.
#
# The _OpenSSH_ daemon obtains its configuration from the below sources
# in the following order:
#
#   . Command line options.
#
#   . System configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).
#
# The configuration file is divided into sections.  Each section starts
# with a `Match` expression that ends at the next section or global
# section at the end of file.  A section defines the settings specific
# to that one.
#
# For each setting only the one of the first matching section in the
# direction from top to bottom is applied.  Therefore more specific
# sections must be defined before less specific ones for their settings
# to become effective.
#
# Fallback settings may be defined in either the global section without
# `Match` expression or `Match all`.  Such a setting becomes effective
# if no setting was found in a more specific section.  The global
# section must be defined at the end of this file.
