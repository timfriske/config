# = GnuPG's GPG configuration
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# A program to a/symmetrically encrypt and decrypt data as well as
# digitally sign that data in order to verify its integrity and
# authenticity later on.  For its asymmetric encryption and digital
# signature verification _GnuPG_ makes use of public key cryptography.
#
# A _GnuPG_ public key and its private counterpart may also be used as a
# drop-in replacement for a Secure Shell (SSH) key to grant access to
# remote systems.
#
# == Important Security Considerations
#
# WARNING: For maximum security you should have different keys for
# different purposes namely one and only one for each of _GnuPG_'s key
# capabilities.  These are `[C]ertification' for certifying keys,
# `[S]igning' for signing data, `[E]ncryption' for encrypting data and
# `[A]uthentication` for authenticating to remote systems.  Keep your
# secret certification keys encrypted and offline â€” or at least
# encrypted and separate from your secondary keys.  Your secret
# certification keys are the most valuable and thus important ones and
# therefore must be protected against any disclosure and misuse under
# all circumstances.  With these keys you establish your online identity
# and prove to others that it is really you they are engaging with.
# Your certification keys are the only kind of keys others have
# carefully verified before they certify and trust them.  You have been
# warned!

# Use the last of the explicitly given secret keys that exists as the
# default key for signing.  Don't rely on some arbitrary secret key that
# happens to be the first key that was found and therefore implicitly
# chosen by _GPG_.
#
# Besides the secret key chosen by default try further secret keys when
# attempts are made to decrypt a message with hidden recipients and the
# correct decryption key must be guessed by trial and error.

# Allow _GPG_ to put the same ultimate trust in the following keys as
# you do in your secret keys.  You should list all your secret keys you
# use for certification here and subsequently move them to an encrypted
# storage medium that you keep offline in order to protect these keys
# against disclosure and misuse.

# Add each of the given keys as one of the default recipients of an
# encrypted message in that order to have them automatically addressed
# if none was given with the option `recipient` or else each of the keys
# given with `encrypt-to` as a recpient to additionally encrypt to.
#
# When it comes to the decision of either disclosing the recipients to
# others or hiding these from those the most flexible way is to specify
# the default recipients with the options `default-recipient` and
# `encrypt-to` as opposed to the options' `hidden' counterparts in this
# configuration file.  By doing so this decision can be deferred and
# made at runtime by invoking _GPG_ with the option `throw-keyids` to
# discard all key IDs and therefore hide all recipients in an ad hoc
# fashion.

# While locally exporting keys:
#
#   * keep the exported copies clean by removing all unusable user IDs
#     and signatures.  Exporting a minimal key ring only makes sense on
#     occasion when we do not want to disclose its social graph more
#     often than needed.
#   * do not export photo IDs a.k.a attributes since we favor user IDs
#     a.k.a text IDs which do not bloat the size of the key rings with
#     image data.
#
# For key backup please invoke _GPG_ with `--export-options backup`.
# The export option `backup` safely overrides all incompatible export
# options.

# While locally importing keys:
#
#   * keep the imported copies clean by removing all unusable user IDs
#     and signatures.  Importing a minimal key ring usually does not
#     make sense because it would lose valid signatures made by others
#     making it impossible to rebuild the Web of Trust among the keys in
#     the local key box.
#
# For key restore please invoke _GPG_ with `--import-options restore`.
# The import option `restore` safely overrides all incompatible import
# options.

# Always ask the user for a certification level when signing a key and
# expect him to certify a key according to level 2 with the meaning as
# documented in _GnuPG_'s info page, namely that ``you did casual
# verification of the key.  For example, this could mean that you
# verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the key
# against a photo ID''.
#
# When the trust database is built treat any level below the minimum,
# except level 0 for ``no particular claim'', as invalid.  You should
# keep the the default and minimum certification levels in sync because
# the default certification level is the minimum of actions you are
# expected to perform in order to conform to that level.  Without a
# clear notion of trust explicitly assigned to keys _GnuPG_'s _Web of
# Trust_ is of limited use only.

# Set the ``for your eyes only'' flag inside encrypted messages in order
# to recommend to recipients that they should rather refrain from
# storing the message in decrypted form.
#
# This flag also prevents _GPG_ from embedding the file name of the
# original file for the following good reasons:
#
#   * The file name hints an attacker at what the encrypted file might
#     contain.
#
#   * Some versions of _GnuPG's_ _GPG_ program and other OpenPGP
#     implementations use this file name to store the decrypted content
#     in a file by that name.  This can lead to unwanted overwrites, a
#     feature that might be abused by an attacker.  Should you really
#     want to store a decrypted copy then all you have to do is to
#     explicitly name the file into which the decrypted content shall be
#     written with the option `output`.

# For maximum security never represent keys by their short or long IDs
# but always by their fingerprints, i.e. the longest form of ID, in
# order to be able to unambiguously identify them.  There have been
# attacks already where fake keys were created with the same short IDs
# as the real keys they should fake.
#
# Important note: Short key IDs must be considered as insecure because
# they were already subject to collision attacks where two maliciously
# crafted keys shared the same short key ID.  According to this an
# attacker could forge an original key and plant it on somebody who
# believes s/he received the original key.  From that point on every
# message the deceived person enrypts with the fake key can be read by
# the attacker.
#
# Note: As a measure of precaution long key IDs should be avoided too in
# favor of key fingerprints.
#
# Print all fingerprints in their compact form, i.e. without
# interspersed whitespace.  This format proved best to be easily
# copyable and pastable and optionally suffixable with an `!`
# exclamation mark to exactly refer to the key with this ID.  _GPG_ does
# not display compact fingerprints by default.  That is why we set the
# option `keyid-format` to `none` and option `with-subkey-fingerprint`
# in this configuration file.  Should you favor the lengthier but more
# human readable format to be permanently printed please uncomment the
# option `with-fingerprint` below.
