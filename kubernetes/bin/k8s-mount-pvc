# Script that helps to look inside a Kubernetes Persistent Volume.
#
# This is especially useful if the code that ran inside a Kubernetes Pod failed
# for some unknown reason and you suspect the error was caused by some missing
# files or wrong file permissions.
#
# In order to accomplish that a Kubernetes Pod with a Container running the
# latest Busybox image is launched. The Persistent Volume that corresponds to
# the given Persistent Volume Claim is attached to the Pod and mounted into the
# Container. Once the Pod is ready an interactive login shell is started. For
# this the `ash` shell that comes with Busybox is used.

# Fail-fast script execution.
