====
Quote records with _Bash_ for _Fzf_.

Usage
-----
.Command line syntax
----
fzf-quote [--help]

[<variable>=<value>]... fzf-quote

[read=1|true] fzf-quote
----

Options
-------
--help::
  Print this program's help text.

[read=1|true]::
  Read new-line-terminated records.

The program _Fzf-quote_ reads unquoted records from the standard input
stream, quotes all special characters it finds in these records and
writes them in quoted form back to the standard output stream.

When _Fzf-quote's_ standard input stream is connected to a terminal it
expects each unquoted record to appear on a new line.  Otherwise, e.g.
when _Fzf-quote_ reads from a file or another program, it assumes each
unquoted record to be terminated with a `\0` null character.  The latter
assumption may be overridden by passing _Fzf-quote's_ `read` variable
set to either `1` or `true`.
