# Simple file type detection
# ==========================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Simple utility program to detect the type of a file.  Detects the
# types of any given number of files.  If a given file does not exist it
# is searched in the directories listed in the `PATH` environment
# variable and the first match is returned if any.
#
# Think about aliasing this helper program as e.g. `ft` (file type)
# should you be using it frequently.
#
# See also:
#   * man:bash[1]
#   * man:file[1]
