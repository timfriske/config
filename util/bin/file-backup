# Numbered backup of single file
# ==============================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Simple backup utility to backup a single file by creating numbered
# backups of that file.  Upon every invocation with the same file
# argument this utility creates another file with an increasing number
# embedded in its file name.  For example given the file `foobar.txt`
# over time the files `foobar.txt~1~`, `foobar.txt~2~` etc. come into
# existence.
#
# Think about aliasing this helper program as e.g. `bk` (`backup`)
# should you be using it frequently.
#
# Dependencies:
#   cp:: Cp command.
#   env:: Env command.
#   sh:: POSIX-compatible shell.
