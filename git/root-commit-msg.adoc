Start new commit history w/ empty root commit

Start a new commit history with an empty root commit.

== Problem

Various _Git_ commands do not work correctly when run on an empty
orphaned branch, i.e. a branch without root commit yet.  This
unfortunate situation is encountered every time a new _Git_ repository
is initialized.  That is because _Git's_ `init' command neither creates
such a root commit by default nor can it be told to do so leaving the
_Git_ repository empty behind.

Without such a root commit on an orphaned branch it is not possible for
example to rename that branch or create any further branches until that
commit is made.

Whether an ordinary or empty commit becomes the root commit of an
orphaned branch does not matter.  The only thing that matters is a
non-empty orphaned branch for the _Git_ commands to function.

== Solution

Initialize an empty orphaned branch with an empty root commit in order
to make the non functioning _Git_ commands work again as they normally
would when there were commits they could operate on.

Start a new commit history with an empty root commit upon which the
history can evolve with every new child commit leading back through the
directed acyclic graph of ancestor commits to that oldest parent commit
eventually.  All these commits live on an orphaned branch, i.e. a branch
totally disconnected from all other orphans.

An orphaned branch, i.e. an independent commit history, can be created
by running the following commands; of which several ones may come into
existence as needed:

.Independent Commit History Creation
----
$ git checkout --orphan <new_branch>
(new orphaned branch <new_branch> created)

$ git commit --allow-empty --no-edit --file="$this_document" \
> --signoff --gpg-sign
(new empty root commit with this document as message created)
----

=== Alternative

Technically seen some arbitrary non-empty commit could become the root
commit but from a logical perspective it feels *not right* that such an
_ordinary_ commit should take this _special_ position.
