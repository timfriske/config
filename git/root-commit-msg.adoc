Start new commit history w/ empty root commit

Start a new commit history with an empty root commit.

== Problem

Various _Git_ commands do not work correctly when run on an empty
orphaned branch, i.e. a branch without root commit yet.  This
unfortunate situation is encountered every time a new _Git_ repository
is initialized.  That is because _Git's_ `init' command neither creates
such a root commit by default nor can it be told to do so leaving the
_Git_ repository empty behind.

Without such a root commit on an orphaned branch it is not possible for
example to rename that branch or create any further branches until that
commit is made.

Whether an ordinary or empty commit becomes the root commit of an
orphaned branch does not matter.  The only thing that matters is a
non-empty orphaned branch for the _Git_ commands to function.
