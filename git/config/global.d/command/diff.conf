# = Git Diff's global configuration
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Configures the `git-diff` command of _Git_.
#
# _Git_ is a _DVCS_ _Distributed Version Control System_ which manages
# snapshots of a file system tree once the tree's nodes are put under
# _Git's_ control.
#
# It is recommended to copy this file into the folder `global.d/command`
# underneath _Git's_ configuration folder `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git`, give it the
# name `diff.conf` and include it in _Git's_ global configuration file
# `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config` (symbolic link to `global.conf`).
#
# See also:
#   * man:git-diff[1]
#   * man:git-config[1]

# Note:
#
#   * When defining aliases all command options must be specified in
#     their long form such that users can understand them even after a
#     long time.
#
#   * Only define aliases for the most common use cases and in this
#     context also only with the most frequently used command options.
#
#   * Specify the arguments to the `stat` option on the command line
#     only when its configured behavior should change.  It's standard
#     behavior should be configured with _Git's_ variable
#     `diff.statGraphWidth`.
#
#   * Specify the arguments to the `dirstat` option on the command line
#     only when its configured behavior should change.  It's standard
#     behavior should be configured with _Git's_ variable `diff.dirstat`
#     set to `lines,noncumulative,3`.
