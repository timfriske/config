# = Git's global config of miscellaneous settings
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Configures miscellaneous settings of _Git_.
#
# _Git_ is a _DVCS_ _Distributed Version Control System_ which manages
# snapshots of a file system tree once the tree's nodes are put under
# _Git's_ control.
#
# It is recommended to copy this file into the folder `global.d` below
# _Git's_ configuration folder `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git`, give it the name
# `misc.conf` and include it in _Git's_ global configuration file
# `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config` (symbolic link to `global.conf`).

#   * man:git-config[1]
