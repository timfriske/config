# Startup file for Bash login shells
# ==================================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# The _Bash_ _Bourne Again Shell_ reads and executes commands from its
# configuration files but only if these exist and are readable.  When
# started as a login shell it first reads its system-wide startup file
# `/etc/profile`.  It then continues to read the first of its user-
# specific startup files `~/.bash_profile`, `~/bash_login` and
# `~/.profile` it encounters in that order.  When a login shell is
# exited _Bash_ reads and executes commands from its user-specific
# shutdown file `~/.bash_logout`.
#
# This configuration file shall contain only non-default settings
# specific to login shells in order to keep it lean and thus easy to
# understand and maintain.
