# Startup file for Bash login shells
# ==================================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# The _Bash_ _Bourne Again Shell_ reads and executes commands from its
# configuration files but only if these exist and are readable.  When
# started as a login shell it first reads its system-wide startup file
# `/etc/profile`.  It then continues to read the first of its user-
# specific startup files `~/.bash_profile`, `~/bash_login` and
# `~/.profile` it encounters in that order.  When a login shell is
# exited _Bash_ reads and executes commands from its user-specific
# shutdown file `~/.bash_logout`.
#
# This configuration file shall contain only non-default settings
# specific to login shells in order to keep it lean and thus easy to
# understand and maintain.  In case an interactive login shell is
# started this startup file shall read and execute the commands from
# _Bash's_ user-specific startup file for interactive shells, namely
# `~/.bashrc`.

# Environment variables
# ---------------------

# Remember up to 100,000 one hundred thousand commands in memory and on
# disk.  Record the time when each command entered history as an
# ISO-8601 timestamp.  Exclude commands starting with whitespace from
# history.  Erase all duplicate commands from history before the same
# command is appended to history.  Exclude any command from history
# which matches one of the patterns specified in the ignore list.  In
# other words either a simple command that is spanning only one word, or
# ends in either one of the long options or subcommands `help` or
# `version`.
