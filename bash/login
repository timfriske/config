# Startup file for Bash login shells
# ==================================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# The _Bash_ _Bourne Again Shell_ reads and executes commands from its
# configuration files but only if these exist and are readable.  When
# started as a login shell it first reads its system-wide startup file
# `/etc/profile`.  It then continues to read the first of its user-
# specific startup files `~/.bash_profile`, `~/bash_login` and
# `~/.profile` it encounters in that order.  When a login shell is
# exited _Bash_ reads and executes commands from its user-specific
# shutdown file `~/.bash_logout`.
#
# This configuration file shall contain only non-default settings
# specific to login shells in order to keep it lean and thus easy to
# understand and maintain.  In case an interactive login shell is
# started this startup file shall read and execute the commands from
# _Bash's_ user-specific startup file for interactive shells, namely
# `~/.bashrc`.

# Environment setup
# -----------------

# Set up the `PATH` environment variable.
#
source ~/.bash/login.d/path.bash

# Set up the environments of various programs.
#
for script in $(shopt -s globstar; \
    printf '%s\n' ~/.bash/login.d/drop-in/**/*.bash); do
  source "$script"
done
unset script

# Test if login shell has startup file with local overrides.
if [[ -f ~/.bash_login.local && -r ~/.bash_login.local ]]; then
  # Read and execute commands from that startup file.
  source ~/.bash_login.local
fi

# Interactive login shells
# ------------------------

# Test if interactive shell and its startup file is readable.
if [[ "$-" == *i* && -f ~/.bashrc && -r ~/.bashrc ]]; then
  # Read and execute commands from its startup file.
  source ~/.bashrc
fi
