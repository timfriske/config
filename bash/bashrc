# Startup file for Bash interactive shells
# ========================================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# The _Bash_ _Bourne Again Shell_ reads and executes commands from its
# configuration files but only if these exist and are readable.  When
# started as an interactive shell it first reads its system-wide startup
# file `/etc/bash.bashrc`.  It then continues to read its user-specific
# startup file `~/.bashrc`.
#
# This configuration file shall contain only non-default settings
# specific to interactive shells in order to keep it lean and thus easy
# to understand and maintain.  In case an interactive login shell is
# started this startup file shall be read and its commands executed by
# the first of _Bash's_ user-specific startup files for login shells
# that _Bash_ encounters, that is `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login` or
# `~/.profile`.
